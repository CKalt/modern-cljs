# Tutorial 14 - A friend is more valuable of a treasure

In the [latest tutorial][1] we were able to reach the following decent
objectives:

* follow the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle by sharing the rules
  of the `Login Form` validation between the server-side and the
  client-side code. To reach this result we used the [Valip][2] library
  and the `:crossovers` build option of [lein-cljsbuild][3];
* adhere to the progressive enhancement strategy by defining and
  remotising a server-side only validator. To reach this result we used
  [Valip][2] and [Shoreleave][4] libraries.

To complete the use of the `Login Form` as a reference sample for our long
journey in the CLJS/CLJ land, we need to fill few residual gaps.

# Introduction

In this tutorial we're going to add to the `modern-cljs` project some
kind of security

* introduce some kind of security in the client-server communication;
* introduce a database of user on the server-side;
* adhere to introduce a kind of html templating system to be used when the browser
  JS is disabled or when the browser doesn't support JS;
* introduce a DOM templating system to be used on the

# Next step - TBD
